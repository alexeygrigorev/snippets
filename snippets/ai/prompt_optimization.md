Prompt optimization is crucial for getting high-quality responses from language models. Here are some effective strategies:

## Basic Structure

```python
# Example: Structured prompt with clear instructions
prompt = """
You are an expert Python programmer. 
Please analyze the following code and suggest improvements.

Code:
{code}

Focus on:
1. Performance optimization
2. Code readability
3. Best practices
"""
```

## Few-Shot Learning

```python
# Example: Using few-shot examples to guide the model
prompt = """
Convert natural language to SQL queries.

Example 1:
Input: "Show all users"
Output: SELECT * FROM users;

Example 2:
Input: "Count active customers"
Output: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE status='active';

Now convert: {user_input}
"""
```

## Key Principles

- Be specific and clear about the desired output format
- Provide examples when possible
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Use delimiters to clearly indicate different sections
